## 22
Memory Settings (LOOP)
## TRACK 1–5
-    You can press the [TRACK] buttons for tracks 1–5 to show the track settings screen for each track.
ParameterValue (Bold: default)Explanation
## REVERSE
## OFF, ON
Specifies conventional playback (OFF) or reverse playback (ON).
-   When REVERSE is set to “ON”, you won’t be able to switch to overdubbing after a recording has
been completed.
## 1SHOT
Specifies whether the track playback will be one-shot (ON) or not one-shot (OFF; conventional loop playback).
Track 2: ON
Track 1: OFF
If 1SHOT is ON, playback will stop
when it reaches the end of the
phrase.
OFFConventional loop playback.
## ON
The phrase will play only once from the beginning to the end of the track, and then stop
automatically (One-Shot Playback).
If you press the [J/t] button during playback, playback will begin again from the beginning of
the track (Retrigger Playback). Overdubbing cannot be carried out.
-   If you don’t want to use tempo synchronization, set TEMPO SYNC SW (p. 3) “OFF”.
## PA N
L50–CENTER–R50Specifies the stereo position (pan) of the track.
## PLAY LEVEL
0–100–200Adjusts the playback level of the tracks.
## START MODE
Specifies whether playback starts with a fade-in or immediately when the track plays.
IMMEDIATEPlayback starts immediately.
## FADE
Playback starts while fading in.
-   You can use “FADE TIME” (p. 4) to specify the length of the fade-in.
## STOP MODE
Specifies how the track will stop when you press the [
## 9
] button.
5The [J/t] button will blink until playback stops.
5If you press the [
## 9
] button once again before playback stops, playback will stop immediately.
-   You can’t overdubbing during the time until playback stops.
IMMEDIATEPlayback will stop immediately.
## FADE

LOOPPlayback will continue to the end of the loop, and then stop.
## DUB MODE
Specifies the overdubbing method.
## OVERDUB
The new performance is layered onto the prerecorded tracks.
If overdubbing is repeated, the next performance is layered on top of the previous material,
allowing you to create an ensemble in a single track.
## REPLACE1
Tracks with existing recordings are overwritten as new tracks are recorded over them.
Overwriting takes places while the previously recorded tracks are played back, allowing you to
achieve a kind of delay effect similar to that obtained from an effects processor.
## REPLACE2
Tracks with existing recordings are overwritten as new tracks are recorded over them.
You can record over a track that has already been recorded, without playing that track.
## FX
OFF, ONSpecifies whether to apply input/track FX (ON) or not (OFF).

Specifies whether tracks 1 and 2 play back simultaneously.
MULTI:Track 1
## Track 2
SINGLE:Track 1
## Track 2

starts playing.
## MULTI
Play back all tracks.
-   To ensure that playback always takes place from the beginning of the phrase, you need to set
LOOP SYNC SW (p. 3) to “OFF”.
## SINGLE
Play back only a single track.
The currently-playing track stops when the other track starts playing.
-   If SINGL CHNGE is set to “LOOP END”, the track will change at the end of the loop.

## 33
Memory Settings (LOOP)
ParameterValue (Bold: default)Explanation
## MEASURE
You can specify the number of measures for each track. When recording along with rhythm sounds or other tracks, it’s
convenient to specify the number of measures before you record, so that looping will occur at the specified measure
length, even if you don’t operate the switch when you’ve finished recording.
-   This parameter is available only if LOOP SYNC SW is “ON”.
Track 1: One measure
Track 2: Four measures
## AUTO
Tracks that are set to AUTO will have the same number of measures. The number of measures is
determined by the first-recorded track of the tracks that are set to AUTO.
For example, if all tracks are set to AUTO, the value set as the number of measures for the second and
subsequent tracks will be identical to the number of measures in the first track that was recorded.
FREEThe number of measures will be set automatically, corresponding to the length of the recording.
## ̃–1–
The number of measures will be set manually.
If you select a note, you can make the length shorter than a single measure.
-   When LOOP SYNC MODE is set to “LOOP LENGTH” (p. 3), the number of measures is adjusted
according to the length set in LOOP LENGTH.
## LOOP SYNC

When loop sync is used, the memory’s tempo or the tempo synchronized to another track whose LOOP SYNC SW
is “ON” is used for recording and playback.
## OFF
Records or plays back when you press the buttons.
This lets you play back a loop with an unspecified length, without syncing to the memory’s
tempo or to the tempo of another track.
## ON
The tempo that’s used for recording or playback is either the memory’s tempo or the tempo
synchronized to another track whose LOOP SYNC SW is “ON”.
## MODE
Sets how the loop sync operates (how syncing is performed).
## IMMEDIATE
Recording or playback starts right when you press the buttons.
The length of the track to be recorded is adjusted in units of one measure.
## MEASURE
Recording or playback starts at the beginning of a measure.
The length of the track to be recorded is adjusted in units of one measure.
Tracks that are played back start at the beginning of the phrase, in time with the beginning of
other tracks and measures.
## LOOP
## LENGTH
Recording or playback starts at the beginning of a measure.
The length of the track to be recorded is adjusted according to the length set in LOOP LENGTH (p. 4).
The track to be played back starts in time with the beginning of other tracks, in units set by LOOP
## LENGTH.
## TEMPO SYNC
## SW
Specifies whether each track plays at its original tempo (the tempo during recording) or at the tempo that is
specified in memory.
OFFThe track will play at its own original tempo.
ONThe track will play at the memory tempo. Tracks 1–5 play at the same tempo.
## MODE
When TEMPO SYNC SW is “ON”, this sets whether to change the pitch according to the tempo, or to instead
make the pitch stay the same.
PITCHThe pitch changes according to the tempo.
XFADEAdjusts the playback speed to match the tempo without changing the pitch.
## SPEED
Sets the playback speed for each track.

DOUBLEPlays back at twice the speed of the original tempo.
## BOUNCE IN
## OFF, ON

not (OFF) during recording or overdubbing.
## INPUT
## MIC 1, 2
## OFF, ON

the track (ON) or not (OFF) during recording.
Turn the [1] knob to select the input jack/connector or RHYTHM, and press the [1] knob to switch
between ON/OFF.
-   When STEREO LINK (p. 9) is “ON”, the MIC 1, 2 and L/R channels are shown as a single
connector.

## QUANTIZE
With tracks for which LOOP SYNC SW (p. 3) is “ON”, under any of the conditions listed below, your timing will be
corrected (Loop Quantize) based on the tempo and time signature of the rhythm, even if the timing at which you press a
button is slightly inaccurate.
5If the rhythm is on
5If there is an already-recorded track whose LOOP SYNC SW is turned on
5If the MIDI Sync is on
-   The QUANTIZE setting applies only during recording. It is ignored during overdubbing or playback.
-   When you stop recording, it is quantized to match the measure length of the previously-recorded track (LOOP SYNC SW:
