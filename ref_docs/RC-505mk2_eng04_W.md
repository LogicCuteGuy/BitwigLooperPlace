WARNING
Concerning the Auto Off function
The power to this unit will be turned off
automatically after a predetermined amount
of time has passed since it was last used for
playing music, or its buttons or controls were
```
operated (AUTO OFF function). If you do not want the
```
power to be turned off automatically, disengage the
```
AUTO OFF function (p. 18).
```
WARNING
Use only the supplied AC adaptor and the correct
voltage
Be sure to use only the AC adaptor supplied
with the unit. Also, make sure the line voltage
at the installation matches the input voltage
specified on the AC adaptor’s body. Other AC
adaptors may use a different polarity, or be designed
for a different voltage, so their use could result in
damage, malfunction, or electric shock.
Use only the supplied power cord
Use only the attached power cord. Also, the
supplied power cord must not be used with
any other device.
CAUTION
Handle the ground terminal carefully
If you remove the screw from the ground
```
terminal, be sure to replace it; don’t leave
```
it lying around where it could accidentally
be swallowed by small children. When
refastening the screw, make that it is firmly fastened,
so it won’t come loose.
Precautions concerning use of phantom power
supply
Always turn the phantom power off when
connecting any device other than condenser
microphones that require phantom power.
You risk causing damage if you mistakenly
supply phantom power to dynamic microphones,
audio playback devices, or other devices that don’t
require such power. Be sure to check the specifications
of any microphone you intend to use by referring
```
to the manual that came with it. (This instrument’s
```
```
phantom power: 48 V DC, 10 mA Max)

How the RC-505mkll Is Organized
Track
Tracks are used for recording and playing back audio from a
microphone or a musical instrument.
You can combine tracks 1–5 when using this unit.
Input FX, Track FX
Effects that are applied to the input audio are called “input FX”,
and effects that are applied to the tracks are called “track FX”.
```
You can register 16 input/track FX (4 banks x 4 types) to the
```
buttons and use them.
Use the [INPUT FX]/[TRACK FX] knobs to control the parameters
specified for each effect in real time.
Rhythm
In addition to playing back tracks 1–5, you can also play rhythms
with this unit.
You can record while listening to a rhythm at the tempo you
specify.
Memory
The settings for tracks 1–5 together with the input FX/track FX and
rhythm are collectively called a “memory”.
You can store up to 99 memories with this unit.
System settings
Settings that are common to the RC-505mkll overall such as the
display contrast, USB and MIDI settings are called “system settings”.

Controlling an External MIDI Device from the RC-505mkll
Overview Explanation
Transmitting tempo data and data for starting and stopping playback
The RC-505mkll’s performance
tempo data is transmitted to
external MIDI devices as MIDI
Clock.
Setting an external MIDI device to the same tempo as the RC-505mkll
MIDI Clock messages are output from the RC-505mkll at all times.
Set the external MIDI device beforehand so it is ready to receive MIDI Clock and MIDI Start and
Stop messages. For details, refer to the owner’s manual of your device.
Playback start and stop operations
with the RC-505mkll’s switches can
be transmitted as MIDI Start and
Stop messages.
Transmitting Start/Stop
A MIDI Start message is transmitted at the moment that recording or playback of the track begins,
when tracks had been stopped. This message is also transmitted when an All Start is carried out.
A MIDI Stop message is transmitted when tracks have stopped. This is also transmitted when All
Stop is carried out.
- If you want MIDI synchronized performance to continue even after the track stops, set the
```
RHYTHM parameter STOP TRIG (p. 15) to “OFF”.
```
- Tracks whose 1SHOT setting (p. 14) is “ON” and tracks whose LOOP SYNC SW setting (p. 14) is
“OFF” will not transmit Start/Stop data.
Transmitting Program Change messages
When a memory is selected
with the RC-505mkll, a Program
Change message corresponding
to the selected memory number is
transmitted simultaneously.
Transmitting Program Change messages
When memories are switched on the RC-505mkll, a MIDI Program Change message is transmitted
to the connected external MIDI device. You can transmit Program Change messages numbered 0
through 98, corresponding to the 99 individual memories 01–99.
- Set “PC OUT” (p. 18) to ON beforehand.
- Program Change messages 100–128 cannot be transmitted.
- Bank Select MIDI messages (Control Change #0, #32) cannot be transmitted.
Transmitting Control Change messages
Operating information for the
RC-505mkll’s switches, buttons,
knobs, and an external expression
pedal or footswitch is transmitted
as Control Change messages.
Transmitting Control Change messages
```
If you select a Control Change as the “ASSIGN” (p. 17) target, you can transmit MIDI control
```
change messages by operating the buttons and knobs on the RC-505mkll, or by using an external
```
footswitch or expression pedal (connected to the CTL 1, 2/EXP 1 jack or the CTL 3, 4/EXP 2 jack).
```

data. For details, refer to the owner’s manual of your device.
```
Set the RC-505mkll’s SYNC CLOCK (p. 18) to “AUTO”.
```
- You can’t switch the tempo during recording.
Start/stop data will be received
from an external MIDI device to
play/stop the RC-505mkll.
Receiving MIDI Start
```
When MIDI Start (FA) is received, all tracks will play (All Start).
```
Switching memories
The RC-505mkll’s memories switch
simultaneously upon receipt of
corresponding Program Change
messages from external MIDI
devices.
Switching memories
You can switch the RC-505mkll’s memories with Program Change messages from external MIDI
devices.
You can receive Program Change messages numbered 0 through 98, corresponding to the 99
individual memories 01–99.
- Program Change messages 100–128 cannot be received.
- Even if received, Bank Select MIDI messages (Control Change #0, #32) are disregarded.
Receiving Control Change messages
The RC-505mkll can be controlled
using Control Change messages
from external MIDI devices.
Receiving Control Change messages
You can use Control Change messages from an external MIDI device to control functions that
would be difficult to control using the RC-505mkll’s own controllers.

```
TEMPO TOO FAST
Since the track is being played at a much faster tempo
than when it was recorded, it might not play back
correctly. Adjust the tempo.
TEMPO TOO SLOW
Since the track is being played at a much slower tempo
than when it was recorded, it might not play back
correctly.
TOO BUSY
TOO BUSY OMSG
The RC-505mkll could not process the data completely.
For “TOO BUSY OMSG”:
Since you attempted to apply the loop FX to a phrase
that was set to a significantly slower tempo than when
it was recorded, the data could not be processed quickly
enough.
Lower the performance tempo.
In the case of “TOO BUSY OMSG”, return to the tempo that was
used during recording.
Save the current content to a memory.
If this appears frequently, back up the data to your computer,
then execute factory reset “SYS+MEM”, and then recover the data
```
(p. 24, p. 19).
